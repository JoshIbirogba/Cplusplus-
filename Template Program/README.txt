Course code: CS 2010



//Run the code
To run this code, you can use any C++ compiler of your choice but i would walk you through the steps of using the Linux environment, powered by the ubuntu shell.
Fire/Power up Ubuntu, when the shell is active, press the command key ls to open a file path to the next directory , another prompt then comes up, press cd CS2010.

Press ls to open the next file directory path. You will see a file directory named Template, input cd Template as your next command line argument. 
When that is all done, your next input will be ls, this displays three cpp files, three, header files, one makefile and a README text. The makefile is what will be
used to run this program.
The next command line argument after being prompted is make, once you type make, hit the enetr key and your program will be compiled and an executable will be created.
Make eliminates the need for you to compile the code "manually".
Input the next command line argument ./test to run the code. 
YOU'RE ALL SET.
