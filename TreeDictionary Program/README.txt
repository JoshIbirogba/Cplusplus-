//Run the code
To run this code, you can use any C++ compiler of your choice but i would walk you through the steps of using the Linux environment, powered by the ubuntu shell.
Fire/Power up Ubuntu, when the shell is active, press the command key ls to open a file path to the next directory, another prompt then comes up, press cd TreeDictionary.
Press ls to open the next file directory path. One file directory named TreeDictionary.cpp is displayed, the next command on the ubuntu environment to be entered is make.
Make eliminates the need for you to compile the code "manually".
The make command creates an executable, press ./test to run the code. 
YOU'RE ALL SET.
